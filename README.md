# Crime Density and Hotspot Analysis: Seattle’s Little Saigon
## Prepared for: Friends of Little Saigon
## Subject- Crime Mapping

This project analyzes crime density and hotspot patterns in Little Saigon (2020–2025), focusing on the five most frequent incident categories:

• Gun Disturbance
• Suspicious Activity
• Traffic Violations
• Assault
• Prowler / Trespass

These incident types have the strongest impact on daily safety, particularly around business corridors, residential areas, and transit routes.

The analysis was conducted in collaboration with Friends of Little Saigon (FLS), who requested this study to better understand how crime affects community perception and to explore CPTED-based (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) strategies.

• The primary goals of this project are to:
• Identify spatial crime hotspots and high-risk environments
• Examine temporal trends to understand when incidents are most likely to occur
• Provide actionable insights that support community safety planning, place-activation strategies, and business engagement efforts

This repository includes data preparation steps, ArcGIS spatial analysis outputs, hotspot maps, and interpretations that help guide real-world decision-making in the Little Saigon neighborhood.
