# Crime Density and Hotspot Analysis: Seattle’s Little Saigon
## Prepared for: Friends of Little Saigon
## Subject- Crime Mapping

This project analyzes crime density and hotspot patterns in Little Saigon (2020–2025), focusing on the five most frequent categories -
Gun Disturbance, Suspicious Activity, Traffic Violations, Assault, and Prowler/Trespass. These incident types most strongly affect daily
safety, especially around businesses and transit areas. Friends of Little Saigon (FLS) requested this analysis to better understand how
crime shapes community perception and to explore CPTED-based improvements. Our goal is to identify spatial and temporal crime
trends and provide actionable insights that can guide safety planning, place activation, and business engagement efforts.
